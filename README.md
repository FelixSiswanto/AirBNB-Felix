# Project Overview

Airbnb is an online marketplace that connects travelers with hosts who offer accommodations, ranging from single rooms to entire homes, allowing for unique and localized travel experiences.

InsideAirbnb utilizes publicly available Airbnb data to analyze and visualize trends in the short-term rental market. By aggregating information on listings, prices, occupancy rates, and host activity, the platform provides insights into the dynamics of local Airbnb markets
